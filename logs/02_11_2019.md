## 1. State adventures in React

came across Codepens on the React documentations that uses `super` and `constructor` but wtf are they really??
in comes [@jellythewobbly](https://github.com/jellythewobbly) to explain and save the day:

> It's constructor and super are parts of JavaScript
> It's used in Classes, object oriented programming
> React made it easier for developers by not requiring the call to constructor/super anymore
> Since like a couple versions ago (maybe 2 years ago idk)
> Constructor/super was used in React to declare a class component's state

```javascript
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
 { other parts of the class component here }
}
```
> this can be simply written as

```javascript
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  state = {
    isOn: true,
  };
}
```
> to grasp the concepts of React (with class components), you need to have a good understanding of the "this" keyword
> For a deep dive into constructor/super, read https://overreacted.io/why-do-we-write-super-props/

* so now, you can declare state in class components in React using the second method
* sifu also mentioned:

> also, use arrow functions for all class methods. This way, you don't have to bind the "this" to the method
