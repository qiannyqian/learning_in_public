## 0. Twitter tips!

Hello world! Since I decided to start learning React, I decided to turn to Twitter for some tips - so here are the suggestions on where to go to learn, what(and what not) to do, etc.

The entire thread can be found [here](https://twitter.com/qiannyqianhere/status/1189203237095661568)

* avoid cra after starting on learner apps like counter and todo - it's good to know what react is without all the bells and whistles

* #learninpublic
	* [Shawn](https://twitter.com/swyx)
	* with [@reknowledgeable](https://twitter.com/reknowledgeable)
* get comfortable with propr, state and render
	* [Yishu](https://twitter.com/yishusee)
* skip classes (unless you need to work on an existing codebase), learn Context before learning Redux
	* [Sheldon](https://twitter.com/sheldytox)
* when ppl say "avoid x when learning y" it just means knowing x is not a must to learn y, because in js world, it feels like you need to know a lot before getting started.
	* [Lihau](https://twitter.com/lihautan)
* at least understand the concept of Redux, since useReducer is the cheat mode for hooks - [link to useEffect here](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/#why-usereducer-is-the-cheat-mode-of-hooks)

* Avoid Redux if you can. Itâ€™s really complicated and is useful for only some scenarios.
Learning the lifecycle is really helpful especially since hooks were added.

* [@tylermcginnis](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis) and [@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbo) courses as a starter pack.

*  [@holtbt's](https://twitter.com/holtbt) excellent "Complete Intro..." series (and they actually recently updated it to hooks and other bells & whistles :) )*PS: it's paid tho
	* [Flaki](https://twitter.com/slsoftworks)
* [@ste_grider's](https://twitter.com/ste_grider) #React course on udemy. I didn't understand the basics until I did his course.
	* [yoges nsamy](https://twitter.com/yogesnsamy)
* functional vs class component - what's the diff, which is better for what
* state vs props - how to pass props,  pass methods w callbacks
* what are lifecycle methods; DidUpdate, DidMount etc - what's the diff, which to use for making api calls
* hooks n redux the very last cos the problems with class component is addressed by hooks, the problems with passing state around is addressed by redux - they're bonus
